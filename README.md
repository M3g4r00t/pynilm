# PyNILM - Framework for Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring in Python
---

PyNILM is a framework designed to facilitate research in the field of non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) using the Python programming language. This project provides a structure for the advanced preparation and analysis of data, particularly geared towards machine learning applications.

## Project Structure üèóÔ∏è

PyNILM is structured as a Dev Container, providing a consistent environment for the development and execution of experiments. To use this framework, Docker must be installed on the machine, including the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) for Windows users.

## Built on the Shoulders of Giants ü¶Ñ

PyNILM leverages the capabilities of [NILMTK](https://github.com/nilmtk/nilmtk), a powerful NILM toolkit, for part of its data processing tasks.

## Examples and Demonstrations üìö

The `notebooks` folder contains practical examples illustrating how to use the package and its functions. These notebooks serve as introductory and practical guides for researchers looking to explore the capabilities of PyNILM.

## Quick Start with VSCode Dev Container üöÄ

To facilitate the use of PyNILM, we recommend Visual Studio Code (VSCode) with Dev Containers support. Follow the steps below to set up and start the Dev Container:

1. **Install Docker:** Ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. You can find installation instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

2. **Install VSCode:** Download and install Visual Studio Code [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

3. **Install Remote - Containers Extension:** In VSCode, install the "Remote - Containers" extension to facilitate Dev Container execution.

4. **Open the Project in VSCode:** Open VSCode and navigate to the PyNILM project directory.

5. **Build the Dev Container:** Upon opening the project, VSCode will automatically detect the Dev Container configuration. Click the green button in the lower right (or press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and choose "Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container") to start the Dev Container build.

6. **Access the Dev Container Environment:** After the build, you will be inside the Dev Container environment, ready to use PyNILM.
